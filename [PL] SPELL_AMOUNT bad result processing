* Form to fix badly working for Poland FM 'SPELL_AMOUNT'
* Pass spell-word as a parameter and the result should be better.
* I'm going to update the form with every new case I'll encounter.

* Welp, I encountered new version that works totally different.
* Code below is 100% usless in that scenario.

form spell_amount_process changing p_word.
  replace 'TIJSJATSCHI' with 'TYSIĄCE' into p_word.
  replace 'TYS' with ' TYS' into p_word.
  replace 'SET' with 'SET ' into p_word.
  replace 'STA' with 'STA ' into p_word.
  replace 'STO' with 'STO ' into p_word.
  replace 'DWIEŚCIE' with 'DWIEŚCIE ' into p_word.
endform.
